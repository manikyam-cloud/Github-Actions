## Simple Shell Script Example

Create a shell script in your repository.
Example file name: myscript.sh

Content of the script:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is KK FUNDA Shell Script"
echo "Current Date:"
date

echo "Files in current directory:"
ls -ltr
```

Explanation of this script
Line 1 is the shebang. It tells the system to use bash.
echo prints messages.
date prints system date.
ls -ltr lists all files.

---

## Where to store this script

Store it anywhere in your GitHub repo.
For beginners, put it in the root folder.

Example structure:

```
your-repo/
  myscript.sh
  .github/
    workflows/
      run-script.yml
```

---

## Make script executable (one-time step)

In your system, run:

```
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

Commit and push:

```
git add myscript.sh
git commit -m "added script"
git push
```

If you forget this, you can give chmod inside workflow also.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow to Run the Script

Create file:

```
.github/workflows/run-script.yml
```

Add this content:

```
name: Execute Shell Script

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-script-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Give execute permission to script
        run: chmod +x myscript.sh

      - name: Run the shell script
        run: ./myscript.sh
```

---

## Step-by-step Explanation of Workflow

Step 1: on: workflow_dispatch
This means you can run it manually.

Step 2: runs-on: ubuntu-latest
The script will run on an Ubuntu Linux machine provided by GitHub.

Step 3: Checkout repository
This step brings your GitHub repo files into the runner.
Without this, your script will not be available.

Step 4: chmod +x myscript.sh
This gives execute permission to the script inside the runner.
Needed if script is not executable in repo.

Step 5: ./myscript.sh
This runs the script.
The output of your script will appear in the GitHub Actions logs.

---

## Optional: Running script using bash

If you do not want to use chmod, you can run it like this:

```
run: bash myscript.sh
```

This will work even if the file is not executable.

---

If you want, tell me your actual script name and folder path.
I will generate the workflow exactly for that file.
