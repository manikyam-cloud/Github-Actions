# **KK FUNDA – Core Concepts of GitHub Actions**

# **1. Workflow → Jobs → Steps → Runners (KK FUNDA Diagram Explanation)**

Think of GitHub Actions like this:

```
WORKFLOW (Full Automation)
   |
   |-- JOB 1
   |      |-- Step 1
   |      |-- Step 2
   |      |-- Step 3
   |      '-- Step n
   |
   |-- JOB 2
   |      |-- Step 1
   |      '-- Step 2
   |
   '-- JOB 3 (optional)
```

Simple rule:

> **Workflow has Jobs → Jobs have Steps → Steps run on Runners**

This is the heart of GitHub Actions.

---

# **2. Workflow (Top-Level Automation File)**

Workflow = Your entire CI/CD pipeline written in a YAML file.

📁 File path:

```
.github/workflows/<anyname>.yml
```

Workflow contains:

* Triggers
* Jobs
* Permissions
* Env values
* Concurrency
* Secrets

### Example (Basic Workflow)

```yaml
name: KK FUNDA Demo Workflow

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello KK FUNDA!"
```

### KK FUNDA Explanation:

> Workflow is the outermost box.
> It controls *WHEN* the automation runs and *WHAT* jobs should run.

---

# **3. Jobs (Independent Execution Units)**

A job is a group of steps that run in a **single runner**.

Key points:

* Workflows contain **one or multiple jobs**
* Jobs run **in parallel** by default
* We can create dependencies using `needs:`
* Each job gets a **fresh VM** (for GitHub-hosted runners)

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  unit-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running Unit Tests"
```

### KK FUNDA Explanation:

> Each job is like a separate stage: build stage, test stage, deploy stage.
> A job fails → workflow fails.

---

# **4. Steps (Actual Commands/Actions)**

Steps run **inside a job**.
A job = a list of steps.

### Types of Steps

1. **Shell commands**
2. **Using marketplace actions**
3. **Custom actions**

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Install Packages
    run: npm install

  - name: Run Tests
    run: npm test
```

### KK FUNDA Explanation:

> Steps = Actual work.
> Installing dependencies, running tests, building artifacts, deploying, logging in to cloud, etc.

# **5. Runners (Machines that Execute Jobs)**

Runners are the **computers/servers** where jobs execute.

Two types:

---

## **5.1 GitHub-Hosted Runners (Default)**

GitHub provides the machine for you:

* ubuntu-latest
* windows-latest
* macos-latest

### Features:

✔ No maintenance
✔ Fresh VM every run
✔ Pre-installed tools (Docker, Node, Python, AWS CLI, Java, Terraform…)
✔ Scales automatically

Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

## **5.2 Self-Hosted Runners**

Your own machine:

* AWS EC2
* GCP VM
* Local server
* Your laptop
* Kubernetes pod

### Best used for:

✔ Private environment access
✔ Large builds
✔ Custom tools
✔ Saving GitHub runner cost

Example:

```yaml
runs-on: self-hosted
```

### **Workflow = Entire pipeline**

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                     Workflow                      |
|  (Triggered on push, PR, schedule, manual, etc.)  |
|                                                  |
|   +--------------------+    +-------------------+ |
|   |      Job 1         |    |      Job 2        | |
|   |  (runs-on: ubuntu) |    | (runs-on: ubuntu) | |
|   |                    |    |                   | |
|   | Step 1             |    | Step 1            | |
|   | Step 2             |    | Step 2            | |
|   | Step 3             |    |                   | |
|   +--------------------+    +-------------------+ |
|                                                  |

# **7. KK FUNDA Way: Complete YAML Example of Core Concepts**

```yaml
name: KK FUNDA Core Concepts Demo

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:

  build-job:
    name: Build Stage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build App
        run: npm run build


  test-job:
    name: Testing Stage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-job

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
