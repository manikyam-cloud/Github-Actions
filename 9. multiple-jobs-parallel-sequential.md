Workflow with multiple jobs means a single workflow contains two or more jobs.

Each job runs on its own runner.

GitHub Actions can run jobs in two modes:

1. Parallel jobs
2. Sequential jobs (using needs)

---

Parallel Jobs
Explanation
By default, GitHub Actions runs all jobs in parallel.
Parallel means both jobs start at the same time on different runners.

Example parallel workflow:

```
name: Parallel Jobs Demo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Job1 Step
        run: echo "This is Job1 running"

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Job2 Step
        run: echo "This is Job2 running"
```

Explanation of above
Job1 and Job2 run at the same time.
GitHub provides separate Ubuntu machines for each job.
Total time = maximum time of the longest job.

When to use parallel
When two tasks are independent.
Example:
Run tests on Python and Node simultaneously.
Run security scan and linting together.

---

Sequential Jobs
Explanation
Sequential means one job waits for another job to finish.
We use the keyword "needs" to create dependency.

Syntax:

```
needs: job1
```

Example sequential workflow:

```
name: Sequential Jobs Demo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Step
        run: echo "Building application"

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Test Step
        run: echo "Running tests"

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Step
        run: echo "Deploying application"
```

Explanation of above
Build job runs first.
Test job will start only after build finishes successfully.
Deploy job will start only after test finishes.

This forms a pipeline like this:
build → test → deploy

When to use sequential
When one job depends on output of another.
Example:
Build code first, then run tests, then deploy.

---

Mixed Example
Parallel and Sequential together.

Example:

```
name: Mixed Jobs

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Build started"

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Linting code"

  unit-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running unit tests"

  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running integration tests"

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [unit-tests, integration-tests]
    steps:
      - run: echo "Starting deployment"
```

Explanation
build and lint run parallel
unit-tests and integration-tests both wait for build
deploy waits for both tests
This creates a real pipeline structure

Important Notes

1. Parallel is default.
2. Sequential needs "needs:" keyword.
3. Each job gets its own runner.
4. If one job fails, dependent jobs do not run.
5. needs can include one job or multiple jobs.
